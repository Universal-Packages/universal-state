There are a lot of ways to track your app state nowadays, all reliable and easy to grasp, but sometimes they can feel a little convoluted as your application grows and you start to keep track of a lot of resolvers, transformers, actions, descriptors, selectors and so on. Universal state offers an alternative by just mutating and getting your state by using string paths.

## Install

```shell
npm install @universal-packages/state
```

## State

State class is the high level representation of the state object, it provides all tools related to modify and read from state.

```js
import { State } from '@universal-packages/state'

async function test() {
  const initialState = { loading: true }
  const state = new State(initialState)

  await tate.set('loading', false).await()

  console.log(state.get())
}

test()

// > { loading: false }
```

### Instance methods

#### **`.clear()`**

Clears the state object and emits such big change to all listeners

#### **`.get(path: String)`**

Get any value using a deep path.

```js
const state = new State(initialState)

const value = state.get('and/am/mean/it/0/it/does/not/matter/how/deep')
```

#### **`.mutate(mutator: Function)`**

Mutate enables you to apply all kinds of mutations to the state without worrying about race conditions with other mutations being applied, it takes a mutator function and calls it only when itâ€™s its turn to be dispatched (All mutations are dispatched in a linear way). It returns a [BufferDispatcher](https://github.com/universal-packages/universal-buffer-dispatcher) object in charge of dispatching all mutations.

```js
import { State } from '@universal-packages/state'

async function test() {
  const initialState = { loading: true, auth: { user: {}, empty: true } }
  const state = new State(initialState)
  const user = await getUser()

  const dispatcher = state.mutate((toolSet) => {
    toolSet.set('loading', false)
    toolSet.merge('auth/user', user)
    toolSet.remove('auth/empty')
  })

  await despatcher.await()

  console.log(state.get())
}

test()

// > { loading: false, auth: { user: { id: 1, name: 'david' } } }
```

## ToolSet

Provides the methods to actually change the state, use only these to mutate teh state.

```js
state.mutate((toolSet) => {
  // All the mutations
})
```

### Instance methods

#### **`.concat(path: String, array: Array)`**

Directly append an array into one inside the state

```js
const initialState = { users: { ordered: [{ id: 1 }] } }

toolSet.concat('users/ordered', [{ id: 2 }, { id: 3 }])
```

#### **`.merge(path: String, subject: Object)`**

Merge an object into any place into the state

```js
const initialState = { users: { ordered: [{ id: 1 }] } }

toolSet.merge('users/ordered/0', { name: 'david' })
```

#### **`.remove(path: String)`**

Completely obliterates any part of the state

```js
const initialState = { users: { ordered: [{ id: 1 }] } }

toolSet.remove('users/ordered')
```

#### **`.set(path: String, subject: any)`**

Sets a single value into any part of the state

```js
const initialState = { users: { ordered: [{ id: 1 }] } }

toolSet.set('users/ordered/0/name', 'david')
```

#### **`.update(path: String, updater: Function)`**

Updates a value in the state using a function providing the current value as a parameter

```js
const initialState = { users: { ordered: [{ id: 1 }] } }

toolSet.update('users/ordered/0', (david) => {
  return { id: david.id, name: 'omar' }
})
```

## Listening for changes

The state object behaves just like a event emitter, you can subscribe to changes in the state for a specific path.

```js
const initialState = { posts: { new: [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }] } }
const state = new State(initialState)

state.on('*', (state) => console.log('State changed'))
state.on('posts', (posts) => console.log('Post changed'))
state.on('posts/old', (old) => console.log('Old was created'))
state.on('posts/old/0', (at0) => console.log('Old at 0 is part of the value set'))
state.on('posts/old/0/id', (id) => console.log('Old at 0/id is part of the value set'))
state.on('posts/new', (new) => console.log('Post new did not changed'))
state.on('posts/new/0', (at0) => console.log('New at 0 changed'))

let dispatcher = state.mutate((toolSet: ToolSet): void => {
  toolSet.set('/posts/old/', [{ id: 100 }])
  toolSet.merge('/posts/new/0', { name: 'david' })
})
await dispatcher.await()

// > State changed
// > Post changed
// > Old was created
// > New at 0 changed
```

## Stand alone mutations

You can directly push a mutation without the need of building a mutator function by just calling the methods directly on the state object.

```js
const state = new State(initialState)

state.set('loading', false)
state.merge('auth/user', user)
state.remove('auth/empty')
```
